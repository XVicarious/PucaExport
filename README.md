# PucaExport
Easily Export Your Unshipped Trades!

PucaExport will export all of your unshipped trades in an easy to read, easy to cut out format.  It will gather all your unshipped items and open a new window with everything you need.  It looks something like this:


<b>John Smith</b>
123 Main Street
Nowhere, KS 00000

| 0000100 | Black Lotus | Unlimied Edition | N/A |
| 0000101 | Steppe Glider | Oath of the Gatewatch | FOIL |


And it repeats like that for every card for each individual you are sending cards to.  Just cut out the address if you want and tape it to the envelope, and cut out the card list and stick it with the cards and you're set.  It makes getting trade numbers and addresses so much easier.

Suggestions and improvements are welcome!
